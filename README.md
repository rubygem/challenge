Hello!

There are two programming challenges in this repository. Each has its
own README file, but here's an overview:

1. Task 1 involves using test-driven development to write some code of
   your own. You should use Ruby for this. This will take up the
   majority of your time.

2. Task 2 has a small amount of pre-written code, which you are asked to
   refactor.

We expect you to spend around 4 hours on the tasks, splitting your time
as you see fit. However, we're not strict about this and if you go a bit
over because you want to get something finished then that's fine. But we
don't want to be unreasonable - so you are not expected to stay up all
night coding away!

As you work on your solutions, you should make commits to the repository
along the way, just as you would on a 'real' project. This is so we can
see the progression of how you came to the solutions you did.

Have fun, and feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear!
